## Front-end developer exercise

This repo is the starting point for the VINCO Invest technical interview for front-end developers.
It's a basic `create-react-app` with the service worker and PWA bits stripped out, and the root
component just displays 'Hello, World'. The exercise is written in JavaScript.

Before the interview, you should make sure (on the hardware you intend to use during the
interview) that:

* you have cloned the repo
* you can build and run the repo once cloned with `yarn start` - you're expecting a 'Hello, World'
  page 
* you are familiar with which packages have been installed and which haven't
* you have an IDE set up that you're happy with for editing the code
